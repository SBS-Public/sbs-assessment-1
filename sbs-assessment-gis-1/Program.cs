            // - The first step is to write a method that will allow return the list AND print (Console.WriteLine) the list of laureates based on criteria that might change.
            //   For example, the criteria could be to print all laureates based on category, year, or even for something in the 'motivation'.
            // - The second step is create a method to leverage the pastebin api(https://pastebin.com/doc_api#1) to create a pastebin.
            // - Finally, create a method that will allow us to delete the pastebin.

            // Note: The API Key will have been sent out via email.
